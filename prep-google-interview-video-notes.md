# Communication and Collaboration
- Think out loud while understanding a problem, designing a solution, and writing code
- Be sure to ask questions
- There is no one specific answer

# Algorithms and Data Structures
- Strong understanding of algorithms and commonly used data structures
- Outline your algorithm and discuss it with your interviewer before jumping into the coding
  - This gives you an opportunity to refine your algorithm collaboratively with your interviewer
- Understand the computationaly complexity of your solution - remember you don't have to get an
optimal solution right away
  - Improve your solution after if you can!
- When working out the requirements of the algorithm - think of good test inputs

Data structures you should know:
- Arrays
- Linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Sets
- Maps
- Binary Trees
- Heaps
- Graphs

Algorithms:
- Sorting, searching, and binary search
- Divide and conquer
- Dynamic programming and memoization
- Greedy algorithms
- Recursion
- Graph traversal, breadth- and depth-first


# Coding
- Choose the language you're comfortable with!
- Don't worry too much about memorization, syntax, or punctuation

# Testing and Error Checking
- After finishing your coding inteview, run through 1 or 2 test cases
to test your algorithm
- You may be asked to to test malformed and boundary inputs

# Best Practices
- Explain your thought process during your interview
- Clarify by asking questions
- Improve on your first solution
- Practice on paper or whiteboard
